Today is the day I start blogging about my journey as a programmer and the common problems that I think most programmers stumble upon.

I plan on posting in-depth algorithmic analysis to the code that I create, as well as the data structure's relational analysis.

I'm currently a Junior Computer Science student with a passion for the art of computer programming.

A goal of mine is to code the common datastructures and algorithms from ground-up using Python, then Java, and last but not certaintly least, C.

I hope that I can capture **at least 50%** of the **data structures** and **algorithms** in the [Princeton Algorithms][p-alg] book.

*Carpe Diem.*
