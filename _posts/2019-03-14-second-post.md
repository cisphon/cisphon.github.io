I woke up at 9 am this morning and started working on the code that I produced last night, it was a simple `Node` class and a starter class called `BST` (which is just an acronym for Binary Search Tree) that I created in Python. It was a feat for me because I primarily have programming experience in Java and I learned how to use the object orientation in Python the previous day.

Over the past few days I've been reading the [Python 3.6.8 Documentation][python-docs] and coding along side it to drill the core concepts in my head by **learning by doing**. I read until Chapter 5 and finally decided that I should start trying to implement the fundamental data structures with the newfound knowledge.

I started a [repository][github-repo] on github so I can track my progress while I go through the humbling experience of recreating the fundemental data structures and algorithms using the wonderful programming language Python. It's served me well in understanding the fundamental sorting algorithms like Quicksort and Mergesort and I find that using Java to program these elementary routines makes it incredibly more difficult for me to understand them because I'm worrying if I'm the language correctly(coding) instead of using my brain to figure out the core relationships in data structures (programming).

When I finish programming the Binary Search Tree data structure I'll post a detailed analysis for it and compute the [Tilde Notation][order] --**which is a more understandable and workable order of growth function that Big O notation.**-- and then reduce it the reconizable [Big O notation][order].

Anyway, today I'm going to enable comments on my website.
