My name is ***Jesse Wright*** and I'm a programmer and musician from the United States.

On this website I blog about my hobbies and provide analysis to the programming projects I've done while letting people comment to provide feedback. 

This website is basically a portfolio for me to document my professional life, with an informal attiude.

*Carpe Diem*.
